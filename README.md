# CowBell

## Synopsis
"CowBell" is a lightweight, sample project app where users that work for a business, e.g. Philz Coffee, Safeway, Jack 'N The Crack, can call out safety hazards.  As an onDemand application, users are assigned various "rights and respnosibilities", being able to fulfill a certain number of workflow updates, such as 1) create new hazard issue, 2) take a job, 3) cancel the identified hazard, and lastly: "fix the problem".

This application is WIP (Work In Progress), and is based on an earlier project of mine, which is far more comphrensive, complex, and rich with far more value-added features.  A "Category 5" application if you will.
